# Mineral catalog
This project is a website that displays information about various minerals (AKA rocks). The home page of the site contains a list of all of the minerals in a database (JSON file). Clicking on a mineralâ€™s name opens a page that displays information about the mineral.
The repertory **'provided_data'** contains:

* A JSON file containing the information of each rock
* HTML files as examples of the expected final output
* CSS file containing the pages style

	* cleavage
	* mohs scale hardness
	* luster

![Details display](https://github.com/AaronMillOro/Mineral_catalog_Django/blob/master/provided_data/detail-preview.png) 

* The name of each attribute in the details template is showed in **title case** by using a template filter.

* Unit tests were performed to test that each view is displaying the correct information.

* The templates match the style used in the [example files](https://github.com/AaronMillOro/Mineral_catalog_Django/tree/master/provided_data/example/).
